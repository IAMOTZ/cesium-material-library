# Cesium Material Library

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running on your local

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start:server`

This starts the app(server) on port 7000.

### `yarn start`

This starts the app(client) in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## Other Details

> I spent 3hrs 20mins working on this application as-is.

### Time Constraint ðŸ˜ž

These are things I would have loved to do but wasn't able to get to due to the 3hrs time constraint. Given some extra time, I'm pretty confident I can get them done. Would be more than happy to discuss the implementation I had in mind during the interview call.

- Calculate and display total value of materials listed
- Properly style the UI of the application
- PropTypes check for the components
- Add unit testing
- Validate Material Form input
- Save the Material Form without an explicit submit button
